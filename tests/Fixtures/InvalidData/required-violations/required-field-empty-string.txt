Spec: edge-cases.json (EmptyValues schema with minLength: 1)
Path: Tests empty string validation
Violation: Field 'emptyStringNotAllowed' has empty string but minLength is 1
Expected Error: String length violation at path 'emptyStringNotAllowed': minimum length is 1, got 0
Hint: This field cannot be an empty string
Note: Empty string is NOT the same as null or missing. Tests that present but empty fails minLength
