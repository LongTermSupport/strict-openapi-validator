Spec: simple-crud.json (UserCreate schema)
Path: /users (POST)
Violation: Required field 'name' is present but null (and not nullable)
Expected Error: Type mismatch at path 'name': value cannot be null (nullable is false)
Hint: Field 'name' is required and must have a non-null value
Note: Tests distinction between missing and null for non-nullable required fields
