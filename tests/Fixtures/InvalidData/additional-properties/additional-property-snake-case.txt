Spec: strict-schemas.json (ProductCreate schema)
Path: /products (POST)
Violation: Property 'created_at' not recognized (correct name is 'createdAt')
Expected Error: Additional property 'created_at' is not allowed
Hint: Did you mean 'createdAt'? (detected snake_case vs camelCase mismatch)
Note: Tests detection of common naming convention errors
