Spec: strict-schemas.json (ProductCreate schema)
Path: /products (POST)
Violation: Typo in field name ('nam' instead of 'name') results in two errors
Expected Errors:
  - Missing required field 'name'
  - Additional property 'nam' is not allowed
Hint for 'nam': Did you mean 'name'? (Levenshtein distance: 1)
Note: Tests typo detection and that both missing required AND additional property errors are reported
