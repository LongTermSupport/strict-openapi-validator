Spec: edge-cases.json (NullableCombinations schema)
Path: Tests both null vs missing scenarios
Violation: Tests critical distinction between null value and missing field
Expected Errors:
  - Missing required field 'name'
  - Field 'age' cannot be null (optional non-nullable)
Hint: Null and missing are different. Required fields must be present. Non-nullable fields cannot be null.
Note: This is the "Four Combinations" test case (required/optional × nullable/non-nullable)
