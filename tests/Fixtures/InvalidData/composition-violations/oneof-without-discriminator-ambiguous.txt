Spec: Hypothetical Pet schema WITHOUT discriminator
Violation: Data has properties from both Dog and Cat schemas
Expected Error: oneOf validation failed: data matches 2 schemas (must match exactly 1)
Hint: Cannot determine if this is a Dog or Cat. Use discriminator field 'petType'.
Note: This demonstrates why discriminator is important for oneOf - without it, ambiguous data causes validation failure
