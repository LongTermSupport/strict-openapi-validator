Spec: strict-schemas.json (Product schema)
Path: /products (POST)
Violation: Field 'status' has wrong case (enum is case-sensitive)
Expected Error: Enum violation at path 'status': value 'Active' is not in allowed values
Hint: Allowed values are: "active", "inactive", "discontinued" (case-sensitive). Did you mean "active"?
Note: Tests that enum validation is case-sensitive
